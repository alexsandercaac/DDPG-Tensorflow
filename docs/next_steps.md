# What could be done?

- [] Add learning rate schedule;
- [x] Create different stages in DVC for training, evaluation and visualisation;
- [x] Create a stage with stablebaselines's DDPG for baseline comparison
- [] Extend documentation
- [] Allow for more exploration during warm up time, maybe sample from random uniform distributions initially
- [] Reduce the scale of noise as training progresses
