DDPG Tensorflow
==============================

This repository provides an updated version of the DDPG implementation published in the official Tensorflow keras [website](https://keras.io/examples/rl/ddpg_pendulum/) that works with the new [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/content/gym_compatibility/) API (formerly known as `gym`). In addition to updating the original Jupyter notebook, different Python modules are created for construction of a [DVC](https://dvc.org/) pipeline.
